# DIGITAL CALCULATOR 🧮💻
Welcome to the **Digital Calculator Repository** — where math meets design and every click counts! Built with the power of **C# and Windows Forms**, this calculator isn't just about numbers, as it's about making everyday calculations feel smooth, sharp, and surprisingly fun.

From quick sums to tricky equations, this stylish desktop tool handles it all with a clean, interactive interface and the magic of object-oriented programming behind the scenes. No more clunky buttons or boring consoles — just a smart, sleek calculator that looks as good as it computes.

**Add it. Subtract it. Multiply. Divide.**
Whatever the math, this app’s got your back — one click at a time. 🎯💡

## <a id = "proj_overview"> 🔢 Project Overview </a> 
This application provides a basic digital calculator interface that replicates standard calculator functionality using **C# and Windows Forms Application (WFA)**. It features a fixed-size, aesthetically pleasing form with buttons for input, operations, and result display. Developed with object-oriented programming in mind, the project emphasizes clean design, responsive layout, and seamless interaction between controls — showcasing the practical use of C# in building desktop **GUI applications.** ➕➖✖️➗

## 🌟 Main Features

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design
- Centralized form display (`StartPosition: CenterScreen`)
- Fixed single border style for clean layout
- Aesthetic flexibility for fonts, sizes, colors, and button styling

### 2. Numeric and Decimal Input
- Buttons for digits `0-9` (`btn0` to `btn9`)
- Decimal point button (`btnPoint`) for floating-point numbers

### 3. Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition** (`btnAdd`)
- **Subtraction** (`btnMinus`)
- **Multiplication** (`btnMultiply`)
- **Division** (`btnDivide`)
- **Equals** button (`btnEqual`) to compute results

### 4. Input and Memory Management
- **Clear Entry (CE)** (`btnCE`) – clears current input
- **Clear All (C)** (`btnClear`) – resets the entire input and calculation

The **Digital Calculator** project was developed by second-year Computer Science students from Batangas State University - The National Engineering University (BatStateU-TNEU), Alangilan Campus,  of class **CS-2201**, as part of the **CS222 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming** course. The goal was to apply object-oriented programming principles and file handling techniques in creating a Digital Diary application, transforming theoretical concepts into a practical, functional software solution.
